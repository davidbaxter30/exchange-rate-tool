## Thank you! And I hope you like I've built!

You can start it up with `npm i` then `npm start`

I decided to use NX to get the boilerplate for the application going and some react material components when building it.

Key features

- Monorepo with libraries for components and hooks
- react/typescript with react materials styling tools to style the components I used from their library
- funtional react
- tried to keep it very modular and loosely coupled to make components easier to share and work on
